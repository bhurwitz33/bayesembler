{"name":"Bayesembler","tagline":"Bayesian transcriptome assembly","body":"The Bayesembler is a Bayesian method for doing transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data.\r\n\r\n## News\r\n* **September 4, 2014:** The Bayesembler manuscript has been accepted for publication. Citation information will follow upon publication.\r\n\r\n## In the making\r\nWe are currently working on implementing the following features:\r\n* New splice-graph engine (we currently rely on a third party engine) that will support combining replicates for splice-graph assembly\r\n* Single-end read support\r\n* Support for other mappers (e.g. STAR)\r\n* Improved support for unstranded data (assembly accuracy on unstranded data is currently not optimal)\r\n* Improved parallelisation efficiency\r\n\r\nPlease use the [GitHub issue tracking system](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/bayesembler/issues) to request any features you would like us to implement.\r\n\r\n## Installing the Bayesembler\r\nThe Bayesembler runs on both Linux and OS X and is freely available under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Static Linux x86_64 builds are available under releases ([latest release](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/bayesembler/releases/download/v1.1.1/bayesembler_v1.1.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz)). Please check out the [installation-wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/bayesembler/wiki/Installation) for further information including how to build the Bayesembler from source.\r\n\r\n## Running the Bayesembler\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThe Bayesembler requires *paired-end* RNA-seq data mapped using [TopHat2](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml).\r\n\r\n### Assembly\r\nThe Bayesembler can be invoked with default settings using\r\n```\r\nbayesembler -b <tophat2_map.bam>\r\n```\r\nImportant options include:\r\n* `-s`: Data is strand-specific. Use `-s first` to indicate mate orientation as in the dUTP protocol or `-s second` to indicate opposite orientation. If not provided, the program assumes unstranded data (beware that performance on unstranded data is currently not optimal, we are working on improving this).\r\n* `-p`: Number of threads used for assembly.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nAssembly in [Gene Annotation Format](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format4) (GTF) as `assembly.gtf`.\r\n\r\nPlease consult the [manual-wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/bayesembler/wiki/Manual) for additional options and information about the output.\r\n\r\n## Bug reports, help and feature requests\r\nThe [GitHub issue tracking system](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/bayesembler/issues) can be used to report bugs and request help or new features.

The Bayesembler is being developed by Jonas Andreas Sibbesen, Lasse Maretty and Anders Krogh at the Bioinformatics Centre, a part of the [Section for Computational and RNA Biology](http://www1.bio.ku.dk/binf/) at the [University of Copenhagen](http://www.ku.dk/english).","google":"UA-44694489-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
